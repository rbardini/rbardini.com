And here I go again. After three years using Sweetcron as my CMS of choice, and one year of WordPress before that, I once more go back to the drawing board and start everything from scratch.

After I got into college, I didn't have any more time to write, and social agreggators were becoming the new big thing. (FriendFeed, anyone?) That's why I moved from [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) to the [now abandoned Sweetcron](http://yongfook.com/why-posterous-instead-of-sweetcron), and set up a lifestream that would keep updating my website without any intervention from me.

And how that made me lazy.

When the system did everything for me, I lost my will to write. I couldn't catch up with all the content that I visited, watched, stumbled, favorited, tweeted and who knows what more [social media silly verbs people will come with](http://www.google.com/+1/button/) anyway, so I just sat down and relaxed.

Until the day I got bored--probably like everyone who ever visited this site in the last couple of years. It was too much easy and impersonal. That's why I'm going back to the good ol' _blogging_, now powered by [Textpattern](http://textpattern.com/), which is awesome to design for and, I hope, to write. Please.

By the way, I finally managed to design a dark layout, using every new HTML5 tag and CSS3 technique I could think of. There are fallbacks, but I really don't care that much about older browsers anymore. It is not finished and there are some rough edges, but if I didn't put it online before classes begun, I wouldn't for another six months. A big thanks to [Dave Gamache](http://www.davegamache.com/) and everyone else involved in [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), for bringing a responsive boilerplate so great to the point of making me use a CSS grid system :)

I'm still at college and I still don't have any time, but at least now I'll try to write something. Let's see how it goes.
