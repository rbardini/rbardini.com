I've just migrated this blog from [Second Crack](https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack) to [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), mainly because I wanted to switch away from a PHP-based static site generator. I considered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), specially because it is pretty fast---and it would be nice to learn Go---but I found its template syntax a little off-putting.

It's now being served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) too, with the [code available here](https://github.com/rbardini/rbardini.github.io). I'll write some follow-up posts soon detailing the plugins and scripts I've used to build and deploy the site.

Stay tuned.
