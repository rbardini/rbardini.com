Can a scientist really enjoy the beauty of a flower? Here is what Mr. Feynman had to say about science and the appreciation of nature.

> "I have a friend who's an artist and he's some times taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say, 'look how beautiful it is,' and I'll agree, I think. And he says, 'you see, I as an artist can see how beautiful this is, but you as a scientist, oh, take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing.' And I think he's kind of nutty.
>
> First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me, too, I believe, although I might not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is. But I can appreciate the beauty of a flower.
>
> At the same time, I see much more about the flower that he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside which also have a beauty. I mean, it's not just beauty at this dimension of one centimeter: there is also beauty at a smaller dimension, the inner structure... also the processes.
>
> The fact that the colors in the flower are evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting – it means that insects can see the color.
>
> It adds a question – does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which a science knowledge only adds to the excitement and mystery and the awe of a flower.
>
> It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts."
