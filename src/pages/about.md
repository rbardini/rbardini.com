I'm Rafael Bardini, a web developer currently living in the Amsterdam area.

I work at [Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/) as a Senior Frontend Engineer, helping build the future of online communities and empower redditors.

I designed and built [Carteiro](https://carteiro.app/), a popular and highly-rated package tracking app, as well as several [open-source projects](https://github.com/rbardini).

You can find more about my work and how to contact me on [my résumé](https://rbardini.com/resume).
